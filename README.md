# NFT-Analysis-scripts

A collection of scripts I use to help analyze NFT metadata and sales information.

artblock_sales.py: reads artblocks' sales from etherscan for a given block range.
metadata_lostpoet.py: pulls the metadata for the lostpoets project from the json file.
sales_merge.py: tracks new opensea listings for the 'merge' project.
